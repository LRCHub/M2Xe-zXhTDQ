Watch how the clouds move on before the skies
are clear
Hope to find my strength before they disappear,
oh
If I fell again
Would your shadow still be right behind me
Every sunrise passes
I, I
Wonder how it'd be
Wonder what would change
If you were still here with me
Wonder right and wrong
Whether I was strong
If only I could see
And although time moves on
I try to keep you in my memory
Picture every moment
I know you'd be proud of me so
Watch how the clouds move on before the skies
are clear
Hope to find my strength before they disappear,
oh
If I fell again
Would your shadow still be right behind me
Every sunrise passes
I feel you here
I still go through
A thousand miles
The ups and downs
I did with you
And I write down
A million lines
Of things that I
Could say to you
And it's so hard sometimes
To just come out and say the words
But I miss you
So please don't miss a single thing that I do
Let's watch the clouds move on before the skies
are clear
Know to find my strength before they disappear,
oh
If I fell again
Could your shadow still be right behind me
Every sunrise passes
I will still be here
